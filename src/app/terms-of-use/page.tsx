                    You agree not to export from anywhere any part of the
                    Services provided to you or any direct product thereof
                    except in compliance with, and with all licenses and
                    approvals required under, applicable export laws, rules and
                    regulations. If any part of these Terms of Use is determined
                    to be invalid or unenforceable, then the invalid or
                    unenforceable provision will be replaced with a valid,
                    enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent
                    of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms
                    of Use will continue in effect. The section titles in these
                    Terms of Use are solely used for the convenience of the
                    parties and have no legal or contractual significance.
                    meQasa may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at
                    any time with or without notice to you. You may not assign
                    these Terms of Use, or assign, transfer or sublicense your
                    rights, if any, in the Service. meQasa&apos;s failure to act
                    with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its
                    right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
                    Except as expressly stated herein, these Terms of Use
                    constitute the entire agreement between you and meQasa with
                    respect to the Services and supersede all prior or
                    contemporaneous communications of any kind between you and
                    meQasa with respect to the Services. The following sections
                    of these Terms of Use shall survive any termination of these
